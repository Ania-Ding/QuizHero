<h3 id="toc_5">Must have</h3>

<ul>
<li>As an instructor, I want to create a quiz on the website, so that students can take the quiz online. </li>
<li>As a student, I want to take the quiz and answer all of the questions online, so that instructors can easily receive my answers for the quiz.</li>
<li>As an instructor, I can grade students’ answers online, so that it’s more time-saving and students can check their grades more conveniently.</li>
<li>As a student, I can check my grade online, so that I can see my grade and quiz history at any time.<br/></li>
<li>As an instructor, I want to publish a sign-up link for the created quiz, so that students can get access to the quiz using the link.</li>
<li>As a student, I want to sign myself up to take the quiz, so the instructors can uniquely identify my answers for the quiz.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_6">Nice to have</h3>

<ul>
<li>As a student, I can see the mean value and medium value of this quiz, so that I can know the performance of my classmates. </li>
<li>As an instructor, I want to have auto-grade for multiple choice and true or false questions, so that my life will be much easier.<br/></li>
<li>As an instructor, I want to set a deadline, so students need to complete the quiz before the ddl.<br/></li>
<li>As an instructor, I want to set a time limit, so students need to complete the quiz within the time limit.<br/></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_7">Software Architecture</h2>

<p>This will be a Web-based application and will conform to the Client-Server software architecture. We need the server to store, analyze, modify and send back relevant data, and we have clients to access the server to get necessary data.</p>
