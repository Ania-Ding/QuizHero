Currently, only important stuff like wallet found inside the library will be handed to the security. It is really hard for people who lose their belongings in other common areas to look for their belongings. It is also unclear who people should turn to when they pick up stuff on the campus. Therefore, a uniform Campus Lost & Found platform is needed.\n//\n//\n// ## Potential Clients\n//\n// > Who are affected by this problem (and would benefit from the proposed solution)?

As a person who lost items, I want to post my contact information, so that people who picked up the item can contact me and return it to me.\n// 3.

As a user (either lost or picked up items), I want to browse the posts, so that I can find the owner or the person who picked up my item.\n// 5.

As a user who wants to post a post, I want to add some pictures when necessary, so that it will help the item find its owner.\n// 2. As a user who posts my contact information, I want my contact information to be protected, so that bad guys will not be able to disturb me.\n// 3. As a user who neither lost nor picked up items, I want to add a follow-up of the post, so that I can provide additional information.\n// 4. As a user who browse the posts (potentially someone who lost something) , I want the post to be prioritized and I can also search the posts, so that it can help me find my item.\n// 5.
