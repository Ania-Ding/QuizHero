this is iteration 3 design and planning document.

# OO Design
> A UML class diagram reflecting the "model" for that iteration only.
> Use a software to draw this (e.g. draw.io) and save the diagram as an image. 
> Upload the image and link it in here using this syntax.

# Wireframe
> One (or a few) simple sketch of how the user interacts with the application. 
> This could be a sketch of your user interface. 
> You can draw it with hand and insert it here as an image.

# Iteration Backlog
> List the User Stories that you will implement in this iteration.

- As a student, I want to view the slides uploaded by the instructer so that I can keep pace with the lesson.
- As an instructor, I want to collect students' answers and see the statistical data on my computer, so that I can know how students perform.

# Tasks
> A tentative list of the "to do" in order to successfully complete this iteration. 
> This list will change and it is good to keep it updated. 
> It does not need to be exhustive.

- Combine the slide html and the Quiz html to a functional student version.
- Statistic (Quiz final page) First step of instructor version.
