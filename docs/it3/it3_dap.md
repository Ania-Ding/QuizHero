# OO Design
> A UML class diagram reflecting the "model" for that iteration only.
> Use a software to draw this (e.g. draw.io) and save the diagram as an image. 
> Upload the image and link it in here using this syntax.

# Wireframe
> One (or a few) simple sketch of how the user interacts with the application. 
> This could be a sketch of your user interface. 
> You can draw it with hand and insert it here as an image.

# Iteration Backlog
> List the User Stories that you will implement in this iteration.

- As a student, I want to answer the quiz so that I can interact with the instructor during class.
- As a student, I want to view the slides uploaded by the instructor so that I can keep pace with the lesson.
- As an instructor, I want to collect students' answers and see the statistical data on my computer, so that I can know how students perform.

# Tasks
> A tentative list of the "to do" in order to successfully complete this iteration. 
> This list will change and it is good to keep it updated. 
> It does not need to be exhastive.

- Combine the slides html (converted from Markdown in iteration 1) and the interactive Quiz html (parsed from Markdown in iteration 2) to a complete functional student version (Combine the first two must-haves listed in iteration backlog above).
- Build backend **DAO, Model and API** to process quiz-related data stored in database, get relevant statistics, and sent back to front-end.
- Build front-end using React to receive quiz statistics sent from back-end.
- Create a page including some diagrams on front-end to visually display the quiz statistics. This is also the first step of the instructor version.
