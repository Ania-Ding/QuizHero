# OO Design
A UML class diagram reflecting the "model" for that iteration only.
Use a software to draw this (e.g. draw.io) and save the diagram as an image. 
Upload the image and link it in here using this syntax



# Wireframe
One (or a few) simple sketch of how the user interacts with the application. 
This could be a sketch of your user interface. 
You can draw it with hand and insert it here as an image.



# Iteration Backlog
List the User Stories that you will implement in this iteration.



# Tasks
A tentative list of the "to do" in order to sucessfully complete this iteration. 
This list will change and it is good to keep it updated. 
It does not need to be exhustive.



# Retrospective
The retrospective is an opportunity for your team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next iteration. Review what you had done in iteration 1; note things that you have and have not delivered, note the challenges you had, and reflect on how you shall proceed in the next iteration to do a better job.

What went well?

What to improve?
