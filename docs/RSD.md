### Must have

- As an instructor, I want to create a quiz on the website, so that students can take the quiz online. 
- As a student, I want to take the quiz and answer all of the questions online, so that instructors can easily receive my answers for the quiz.

- As a student, I can check my grade online, so that I can see my grade and quiz history at any time.   
- As an instructor, I want to publish a sign-up link for the created quiz, so that students can get access to the quiz using the link.
- As a student, I want to sign myself up to take the quiz, so the instructors can uniquely identify my answers for the quiz.

### Nice to have

As a student, I can see the mean value and medium value of this quiz, so that I can know the performance of my classmates. 
As a teacher, I want to have auto-grade for multiple choice and true or false questions, so that my life will be much easier.  
As a teacher, I want to set a deadline, so students need to complete the quiz before the ddl.  
As a teacher, I want to set a time limit, so students need to complete the quiz within the time limit.
