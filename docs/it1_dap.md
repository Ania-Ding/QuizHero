# OO Design
A UML class diagram reflecting the "model" for that iteration only.
Use a software to draw this (e.g. draw.io) and save the diagram as an image. 
Upload the image and link it in here using this syntax

# Wireframe
One (or a few) simple sketch of how the user interacts with the application. 
This could be a sketch of your user interface. 
You can draw it with hand and insert it here as an image.

# Iteration Backlog
List the User Stories that you will implement in this iteration.

- As an instructor, I want to upload a Markdown file so that it can be converted to a html containing my slides.
- As an instructor, I want to click and view the returned urls so that I can view my slides on the web browser.

# Tasks
A tentative list of the "to do" in order to sucessfully complete this iteration. 
This list will change and it is good to keep it updated. 
It does not need to be exhustive.

- Implement a simple front-end interface that can interact with the instructor and communicate with the back-end.
- Implement classes described in the UML diagram.
- Explore the possibility of making use of the Marpit modules to convert the markdown file.
