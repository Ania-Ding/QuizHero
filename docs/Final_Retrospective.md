# Final Retrospective
> It is similar to iteration retrospective but you look back over the entire five iterations. In particular, revisit your original project proposal, note on what has changes, what features you have/have not delivered. Briefly note the challenges you had. And, finally, reflect on how you would do it again if you could go back in time and start at iteration 1. You don't need a time machine to achieve this. The next software project you develop, you will start at iteration 1, and I am sure it will be a great one.

### Revisiting Original Project Proposal

#### 1. What we have delivered
We have delivered all of the must-have features and the first two nice-to-have features we set in the project proposal.
* As an instructor, I want to upload a markdown file containing the quiz questions and lecture slides, so that I can start a quiz during the class.
* As a student, I want to answer the quiz so that I can interact with the instructor during class.
* As a student, I want to view the slides uploaded by the instructer so that I can keep pace with the lesson.
* As an instructor, I want to collect students' answers and see relevant statistical data on my computer, so that I can know how students perform.
* As an instructor, I want to have a presenter mode to see all my slides, quizzes and notes, so that I can teach a course and have a better overview of my teaching content.
* As an instructor, I want to log in to the website, so that I can have my personal record.
* As an instructor, I want to review my presentation history, so that I can go through what I have taught.
* As an instructor, I want to control the permission of starting quiz inside the slides, so that I can prompt my students to answer the quiz at the right time.
* As an instructor, I want to control the permission of opening the files I upload, so that I can prompt my students to view the slides at the right time.

#### 2. What we have not delivered
There are 2 nice-to-have features we have not delivered or decided not to deliver at last.
* As a student, I want to download the presentation onto my own computer, so that I can review it after class.
* As an instructor, I want to set a timer module, so students need to complete the quiz or discussion within the time limit.
