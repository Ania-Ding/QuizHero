# Final Retrospective
> It is similar to iteration retrospective but you look back over the entire five iterations. In particular, revisit your original project proposal, note on what has changes, what features you have/have not delivered. Briefly note the challenges you had. And, finally, reflect on how you would do it again if you could go back in time and start at iteration 1. You don't need a time machine to achieve this. The next software project you develop, you will start at iteration 1, and I am sure it will be a great one.

### Revisiting Original Project Proposal

#### 1. What we have delivered
We have delivered all of the must-have features and the first two nice-to-have features we set in the project proposal.
* As an instructor, I want to upload a markdown file containing the quiz questions and lecture slides, so that I can start a quiz during the class.
* As a student, I want to answer the quiz so that I can interact with the instructor during class.
* As a student, I want to view the slides uploaded by the instructer so that I can keep pace with the lesson.
* As an instructor, I want to collect students' answers and see relevant statistical data on my computer, so that I can know how students perform.
* As an instructor, I want to have a presenter mode to see all my slides, quizzes and notes, so that I can teach a course and have a better overview of my teaching content.
* As an instructor, I want to log in to the website, so that I can have my personal record.
* As an instructor, I want to review my presentation history, so that I can go through what I have taught.
* As an instructor, I want to control the permission of starting quiz inside the slides, so that I can prompt my students to answer the quiz at the right time.
* As an instructor, I want to control the permission of opening the files I upload, so that I can prompt my students to view the slides at the right time.

#### 2. What we have not delivered
There are 2 nice-to-have features we have not delivered or decided not to deliver at last.
* As a student, I want to download the presentation onto my own computer, so that I can review it after class.
* As an instructor, I want to set a timer module, so students need to complete the quiz or discussion within the time limit. 

#### 3. What have changed

### Recall the Whole Development Process 

Here we list some major challenges we met, and how we finally overcame them.

### If We could Go Back?

### Looking Ahead
Besides the nice-to-haves that we could implement, we think there are many other cool features that can be implemented to make this application a more powerful education tool:
Currently the style of presentation slides is preset in our code. In future, we could open the styling design to users for customization. This could be achieved by allowing users to upload their own CSS files.
Another feature would be online editing/realtime rendering. If the user were able to edit Markdown online and to have a separate window showing how it looks like after converted to slides, it would provide a better user experience, especially for those who don't have much of experience in Markdown writing.
The design of quiz in our application is more for student participation than actual grading. If the instructor want his presentation and quizzess closer to the format of an actual exam, some encryption process and more strict access to file are needed.

### To Our Advisor
Julia helps us a lot through the 5 iterations. She always provides her best insights and suggestions on our project, and we
find them very helpful in developing a blue print for our design and improving user experience of our application. She has also been very responsive to our questions and emails. We really appreciate your time and effort for this semester, especially under the circumstance of remote teaching. Thank you Julia!
