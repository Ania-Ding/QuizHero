This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run our project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

If you encountered error loading the page, please run the following command to ensure that you have included the necessary external library: 

### ` npm install @marp-team/marpit --save`

And again run:

### `npm start`

I'm sure you will have a start index page shown in your browser with our logo "Quiz Hero" and a upload button, you can upload any markdown file and it will be convert to a slide format html. Currently, we are still on our way of development, the converted html can only be seen if you click the download button and open the downloaded html file.

We haven't finalized our markdown syntax yet, so a random markdown may not give you an ideal converted html slides. We would introduce our syntax in detail after we finalize it. Therefore, we recommend you to use the `example.md` to test the current function, you can find it in the project directory.
